# Sandbox MicroService Architecture

A demo of big data streaming in a microservice architecture. Thee project demonstrates the following:

* Using Docker & Docker Compose (Containers)
* Big Data Streaming via uploading large files in chunks (read/write streams)
* Use of various technologies and techniques
* Using API Gateway and Storage/File Gateway via NestJS
* Using RabbitMQ as message broker to communicate between gateways and microservices (events and Remote Procedure Call a.k.a RPC)
* Using Redis as cache for temporarily holding files in chunks then reading when ready to aggregate/merge
* Using PostgreSQL/Sequelize ORM for recording file uploads as media objects
* Using Splunk for recording logs of events
* Using Winston Logger, inside Logging Microservice, to capture logs in shared volume with Splunk

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
